      <p class="text-center text-margin content-text">
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious respiratory and vascular disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).First identified in Wuhan, China, it has caused an ongoing pandemic. COVID-19 mainly spreads through
      the air when people are near each other long enough, primarily via small droplets or aerosols,as an infected person breathes, 
      coughs, sneezes, sings, or speaks. Transmission via fomites (contaminated surfaces) has not been conclusively demonstrated. It can
      spread as early as two days before infected persons show symptoms (presymptomatic), and from asymptomatic (no symptoms) individuals.
      People remain infectious for up to ten days in moderate cases, and two weeks in severe cases. 
      </p>                    
      <h4 class="main-text text-center">Background</h4>                                        
      <p class="text-center text-margin content-text">
      It is still unknown exactly where the outbreak first started, several early infected people had visited Huanan Seafood Wholesale 
      Market, located in Wuhan, Hubei, China. On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease "COVID-19", which
      is short for coronavirus disease 2019. The virus that caused the outbreak is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2), a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. The scientific 
      consensus is that COVID-19 has a natural origin. The probable bat-to-human infection may have been among people processing bat 
      carcasses and guano in the production of traditional Chinese medicines.The earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered
      to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster. Of the 
      early cluster of cases reported that month, two-thirds were found to have a link with the market. There are several theories about 
      when and where the very first case (the so-called patient zero) originated. On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South 
      China Morning Post (SCMP) suggested a case traced back to 17 November 2019 (a 55-year-old person from Hubei) may have been the first
      person infected. Phylogenic estimates in genetic studies conducted in early 2020 indicate that SARS-CoV-2 likely passed onto humans
      sometime between 6 October 2019 and 11 December 2019.
      </p>
      <h4 class="main-text text-center">Cases</h4> 
      <p class="text-center text-margin content-text">
      Official case counts refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test has been confirmed positive 
      according to official protocols. Many countries, early on, had official policies to not test those with only mild symptoms. 
      An analysis of the early phase of the outbreak up to 23 January estimated 86 percent of COVID-19 infections had not been detected,
      and that these undocumented infections were the source for 79 percent of documented cases. Several other studies, using a variety 
      of methods, have estimated that numbers of infections in many countries are likely to be considerably greater than the reported cases
